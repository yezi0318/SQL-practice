SELECT id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `month` = 'Jan' THEN revenue END) Jan_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `month` = 'Feb' THEN revenue END) Feb_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `month` = 'Mar' THEN revenue END) Mar_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `month` = 'Apr' THEN revenue END) Apr_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `month` = 'May' THEN revenue END) May_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `month` = 'Jun' THEN revenue END) Jun_Revenue,
